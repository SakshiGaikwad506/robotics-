## What is OpenCV?
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a software library used for image processing and computer vision. It allows computers and robots to understand visual information from images and videos.

## What is Computer Vision?
Computer Vision is the field of study that enables machines to see, understand, and interpret visual data like images and videos.

## Image Processing
Image processing includes basic operations such as:
Converting images to grayscale
 Resizing images
 Blurring images
 Edge detection

 ## Use of OpenCV in Robotics
OpenCV is used in robots for:
